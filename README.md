This repository contains code developed for the first project 2018 edition of the Complex Networks class.
The code repository includes the following files/ directories:

1. network_drawings/ <br />
         spring_degree.png - Represention of the choosen graph with nodes who's sizes are proportional to the degree of the nodes. <br />
         spring_uniform.png - Standard rpresention of the choosen graph.
  
2. airlines.graphml - The file representing the graph studied in the project.

3. airports_RC.ipynb - A jupyter notebook document with the pyhton code used in the  project

4. network_drawings.py - A python file used to generate the network_drawings directory.
